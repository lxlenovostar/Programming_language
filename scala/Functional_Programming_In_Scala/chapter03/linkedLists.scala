/*
 A trait is an abstract interface that may optionally contain implementations 
 of some methods. Here weâ€™re declaring a trait, called List, with no methods on it. 

 Adding sealed in front means that all implementations of the trait must be declared 
 in this file.

 the + indicates that the type parameter A is covariant. This means that, for instance, 
 List[Dog] is considered a subtype of List[Animal], assuming Dog is a subtype of Animal.
 */
sealed trait List[+A]

/*
 There are two such implementations, or data constructors, of List (each introduced
 with the keyword case) 

 But notice now that Nil extends List[Nothing]. Nothing is a subtype of all types,
 which means that in conjunction with the variance annotation, Nil can be considered
 a List[Int], a List[Double], and so on, exactly as we want.
